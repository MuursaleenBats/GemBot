      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Import necessary modules:**\n",
      "   - `os`: For interacting with the operating system, like getting environment variables and handling paths.\n",
      "   - `pywinauto`: For automating Windows applications, in this case, Chrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **`get_chrome_path()` function:**\n",
      "   - Defines two potential paths where Chrome is typically installed (for 32-bit and 64-bit systems).\n",
      "   - Iterates through these paths and checks if `chrome.exe` exists.\n",
      "   - Returns the first valid path found or `None` if Chrome is not found.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **`open_website(url)` function:**\n",
      "   - Takes the URL to open as an argument.\n",
      "   - Calls `get_chrome_path()` to get the Chrome executable's path.\n",
      "   - If the path is found:\n",
      "     - Prints the path.\n",
      "     - Uses `pywinauto.Application().start()` to launch Chrome with the specified URL.\n",
      "   - If the path is not found, it prints an error message.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Example usage:**\n",
      "   - Calls `open_website()` with the URL \"https://www.amazon.com\" to open Amazon in Chrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "**To use this code:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install pywinauto:**  Run `pip install pywinauto` in your terminal or command prompt.\n",
      "2. **Save the code:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `open_website.py`).\n",
      "3. **Run the code:** Execute the file from your terminal using `python open_website.py`.\n",
      "\n",
      "This will open Google Chrome (if found) and navigate to the Amazon website.\n",

      "Wildlife, a tapestry of diverse species, is essential for a healthy planet. From the intricate dance of pollinators to the apex predators maintaining balance, each creature plays a vital role. Their presence provides ecological services like seed dispersal and pest control. Yet, habitat loss, climate change, and poaching threaten their existence. Protecting wildlife isn't just about preserving iconic species, it's about safeguarding our planet's delicate web of life, ensuring a healthy future for generations to come. We must act now, through conservation efforts and sustainable practices, to ensure their survival and, ultimately, our own. \n",
